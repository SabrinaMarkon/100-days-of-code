# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 17, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished SASS section of FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I find things easy to learn like this, but then forget the syntax afterward when I am not actively using it, which is frustrating.

### Day 1: January 18, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Review Redux.

**Thoughts**: I was working on PHP so much lately, that I haven't looked at Redux in awhile, so am practicing Redux with FCC exercises, and am going to do the Random Quote App tomorrow using React & Redux, so I've created a pen for this.

### Day 2: January 19, 2019 - Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Redux exercises on FCC (again as a review). Used Object.assign and the spread operator to add or remove from a copy of state.

**Thoughts**: I sometimes find making a copy of state confusing in silly ways.
