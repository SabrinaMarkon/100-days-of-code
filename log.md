# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 17, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished SASS section of FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I find things easy to learn like this, but then forget the syntax afterward when I am not actively using it, which is frustrating.

### Day 1: January 18, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Review Redux.

**Thoughts**: I was working on PHP so much lately, that I haven't looked at Redux in awhile, so am practicing Redux with FCC exercises, and am going to do the Random Quote App tomorrow using React & Redux, so I've created a pen for this.

### Day 2: January 18, 2019 - Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
